				<section title="Allegory Of Cave" class="post">
					<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave" class="link" target="_blank">Allegory of the cave</a></h2>
					<p>A parable by Plato that is presented as an allegory with many meanings and interpretations. 
					Most notably, the parable is an analogue to a philosopher's life. In an another interpretation 
					the parable can be viewed as an argument suggesting that what we percieve as reality with our senses 
					might very well be just an illusion. It could be just that the objects we percieve to be real maybe a
					reflection/projection of some other 'form' which is more real, just like a shadow of an object is not the
					real object itself!</p>
					<p>There's also an excellent TED-ED video on the subject. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RWOpQXTltA"

				<section title="Simpson's Paradox" class="post">
					<h2><a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/simpsons-paradox/" class="link" target="_blank">Simpson's Paradox</a></h2>
					<p>Statistics has always been an intriguing field and is also one of the most practical areas
					of math. This paradox deals with a very bizzare statistical anomaly that arises due to faulty
				       	reasoning. The gap is so subtle that it is almost unnoticeable in first few glances.It is quite
				       	likely that you are going to witness the phenomenon in real life sooner or later.</p>

				<section title="Monty Hall Problem" class="post">
					<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem" class="link" target="_blank">Monty Hall Problem</a></h2>
					<p>A <b>probability</b> riddle that even the best mathematicians got wrong (and refused to believe
					that the correct answer is correct until they were shown the computer simulation of problem
					producing the <i>counter-intuitive</i> answer)? Yes please.</p>
					<p>Hint Hint : Blowing up the numbers also blows the confusion out of monty hall problem</p>

				<section title="Planet need not be saved" class="post">
					<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W33HRc1A6c" class="link" target="_blank">Planet need not be saved!</a></h2>
					<p>This can not be emphasized enough. The popular and widely spread view is that we humans are
					causing harm to earth and the earth is <em>crying</em> because of us. Ha! fools. Our presence is
					insignificant when it comes to universal matters. It is us that need to be protected from ourselves 
				       and not this big planet!	George Carlin, a comedian, who targets popular
					cultural opinions speaks very rightly on this issue.</p>
