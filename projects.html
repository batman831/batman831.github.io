					<h2>NavImage - Replicate directory's naviagtion hierarchy</h2>
					<p>Tool to create image of directory's navigation structure </p>
					<div class="main-content">
					<p>
					Creating an image of HDD is useful, but sometimes you don't want to bother with copying your entire HDD
					but rather only preserve it's navigation structure. This tool allows you to do exactly that. <br><br>
					It replicates the directory structure of a source directory in the same hierarchical manner as the source.
					The only difference is that it does not copy files and their contents.
					Instead it associates each directory with a index.html file containing information about it's files 
					and also linking to relevant directories. <br><br>

					<strong>TL;DR</strong> It replicates entire directory structure in folder only manner 
					and associates each folder with it's index.html file containing list of files originally contained in directory.<br>
					<br>

					Info about usage and specifications on GitHub.

					<h2>SEncrypt - The Text Encryptor</h2>
					<p>Coded in C++, SEncrypt is a text 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption" class="link" target="_blank">encryption</a>
					program. It can be used to encrypt and decrypt text into ciphers to prevent their misuse.</p>
					<div class="main-content">
						<p>SEncrypt encrypts text by creating a ASCII character bijective map whose mapping is random
						and seeded by a <em>key</em> entered by user. The text message is then encrypted or decrypted
						using this map.</p>
						<p>The only <em>feasible</em> way to crack the encryption is to recreate the mapping, which because
						of it's very randomness can only be obtained by obtaining the <em>key</em> of encryption.</p>
						<p>Example -</p>
						<div class="flexed">
							<code>$ ./sencrypt.exe <br>
								Enter a key : mykey <br>
								Your msg : hello world <br>
								Encrypted Output : kBcc&nC&Qc1 <br>
								Decrypted Output : ?1]]{gQ{B]N <br>
							</code>

							<code>
								$ ./sencrypt.exe <br>
								Enter a key : mykey <br>
								Your msg : kBcc&nC&Qc1 <br>
								Encrypted Output : Wr77.Zt.w7e <br>
								Decrypted Output : hello world <br>
							</code>					
						</div>
						<p>The program can also be used to read/write encryptions/decryptions to a text file instead.</p>
						<p>General syntax - </p>
						<code>$ [e or d] [key] [inputfile] <[outputfile]></code>
						<p>Example - </p>
						<div class="flexed">
							<code>$ ./sencrypt.exe e somekey input.txt out.txt</code>
							<code>$ ./sencrypt.exe d somekey out.txt <br>
								1 <br>
								This is some message that is written in input.txt <br>
							</code>

					<h2>Rainfall Physics Simulator</h2>
					<p>This project attempts to simulate rainfall and physics of water-flow.</p>
					<div class="main-content">
						<p>Purpose of this project was to learn dynamic GUI updating in <strong>JavaFX</strong>
						using concept of FPS and to get hands-on experience on a simple physics simulator,
						both of which have been duly accomplished. Side objectives included learning event-handling,
						logic for creation of smoothed landscapes (like those created in games like Minecraft)
						and JavaFX Animations. <strong>All checked</strong>.</p>
						<p>This project, strictly speaking,  is not a true physics simulator - </p>
						<ul>
							<li>There is no concept of <em>velocity</em>. Raindrops are coded such that they move,
								if they can, <em>exactly</em> 1 pixel each frame.</li>
							<li>There is gravity but there is <strong>no</strong> concept of acceleration due to gravity.
								This is implicitly stated in previous statement.</li>
							<li>There is <strong>no</strong> collision mechanics involved.
								Raindrops magically stick to the surface on collision (e=0) but when the collide with land
								laterally they sometimes do, and sometimes do not, bounce back elastically (e=1).</li>
							<li>There is also no concept of <em>potential difference</em>. That is,
								if you were to create 2 connected vessels and fill one of them with water,
								the water would definitely flow to the other but it is not guaranteed that it would 
								attain same level in both.</li>
						</ul>
