					<h2>Sounds : A Blind Maze</h2>
					<p>Echolocate to win and survive. Available on Play Store and PC.</p>
					<div class="main-content">
						<p>Created in Collaboration with my friend Shubham, Sounds ABM is my first android game.
						It features an unique game mechanism, you percieve the surrounding with the help of echos!
						After all, you are out exploring in a dark cave full of fearsome creatures with acute hearing 
						bent on eliminating any foreign creature.</p>
						<p>"Sounds: A Blind Maze" follows the player in a first-person perspective as you navigate 
						through a maze-like cave. The features of the cave can only be made known to you through sounds,
						which your extremely experienced ears can detect with such precision that the player
						visualizes it as light itself.
						<br>
						Beware! If the sound you create reaches the wrong ears, you will find yourself running for your life.
						</p>
						<p>
						Levels of increasing complexity are arranged to test your gaming skills as a shooter as well as navigator.
						Get ready to have your nerves on edge with every step you take!.</p>
						<p>Available on Play Store as beta release.</p>
