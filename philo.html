							How the concept of god may have come into picture - A thought experiment of type What if
						</a>
					</h2>
					<p>Different people take different stance when it comes to belief in god. Some are theist because
					why not, and some are atheists because they simply hate religion for harms it has caused. There are some
					who believe that god and religion are as real and they contain the most powerful wisdom whereas some 
					believe that entire melodrama of religion and god is nothing but hoax intended to instill fear and
					desperation in already weak human. I am not supporting any of these people. They are but unwise.
					When it comes to philosophy you don't take sides just like that. You should have given a thorough thought
					to both sides of argument and then come up with a reasoning, the most logical reasoning that convinves you
					completely to take a side (only if there can exist such reasoning). If you can not come up with such a
					reasoning then you have no right to take any side. Why defend religion when you can't even convince yourself
					of it's authenticity. Why hate religion when you can't even find a better path to live life than devotion?
					It is only the reasoning and thought that you put into it that matters, your end decision does not. If you have put
					enough thought into what you believe is the correct way to see things, and you have developed a reason so convincing
					that it actually appeals to you then you are on the right path, regardless of the path.</p>
					<p>In this spirit, I talk about a thought experiment in which I reason how the concept of god may have come into
					picture and that god and religion are nothing but life philosophy written by some wise philosophers in ancient times
					(That's my belief and the blog a reason to my belief).</p>

							What inside my body is me?
						</a>
					</h2>
					<p>Think about this - when you say I, me, mine, etc. whom are you actually referring to? You, ofcourse. But
					what is you? Is your body you? Is your mind you? Is your soul you? What is you?</p>
					<p>This question is open to both philosophical as well as scientific speculation. There are some
					researchers who even believe that consciousness is an illusion and there is nothing like <em>me</em>
					well defined. But philosophers have more freedom than that. There have been different philosophies
					surrounding this very question. This blog post presents my answer to the posed question. My answer
					in a nutshell is - <em>I am the <strong>tone</strong> of collaboration of the constitutents of my body.</em>
					To know my reasoning behind this answer, read on the blog post.</p>
