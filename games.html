						bent on eliminating any foreign creature.</p>
						<p>"Sounds: A Blind Maze" follows the player in a first-person perspective as you navigate 
						through a maze-like cave. The features of the cave can only be made known to you through sounds,
						which your extremely experienced ears can detect with such precision that the player

						<br>
						Beware! If the sound you create reaches the wrong ears, you will find yourself running for your life.
